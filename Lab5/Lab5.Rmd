## Objectives

  - Understand how to process raster data 
  - Understand how to make maps with `ggmap`
  - Understand what constitutes a point process
  - Detect and create point-pattern density surfaces
  - Identify how points are clustered in space (uniform, random, clustered).

## Introduction

In this lab, we will work on the point patterns of Joshua tress distributed
in the southern California, Nevada and Arizona. The `trees.txt` file in the
`Data` folder includes the locations of trees and types of
pollinator. The second set of data are raster measurements of bioclimatic
variables that are possibly related to the distribution of the trees. In
the rest of the lab, we will first display and pre-process the data for
analysis in `spatstat` and then based on the two datasets, explore and
model the spatial distribution of the trees. 

## Setup

The R package `spatstat` is probably the most commonly used library for
point pattern analysis. We will primarily use it for the analysis. Let's
first load the library and related GIS library. If you have not installed it on
your computer, please install by command  `install.packages()` or the
bottom right menu in `RStudio`. Feel free to use other libraries too. 

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
library(maptools)
library(maps)
library(raster)
library(spatstat)
library(ggmap)
library(ggsn)
```

## Data Mapping and Preprocessing 

### Trees locations

Now let's first take a look at the data we have. The `trees.csv` contains
four columns: `ID`, `longitude`, `latitude` and `pollinator` types. Let's
first map the trees. 


```{r, eval=T, echo=T}

# Load the csv file with lat/long and types
treeLocs = read.csv(file="Data/trees.csv", header=T)

# Get the background map with google maps
bbox <- make_bbox(lon = treeLocs$longitude, lat = treeLocs$latitude, f = .1)
baseMap <- ggmap(get_map(location = bbox, maptype = "toner", source = "stamen"))

# Map the trees with `geom_point()`
treeMap = baseMap +
    geom_point(data = treeLocs, mapping = aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red") + coord_quickmap()

# Add north arrow and scale bar to make the map more professional
treeMap = treeMap +
    north(treeLocs)+ 
    scalebar(treeLocs, dist=40, dist_unit="km", transform=TRUE, model="WGS84")

plot(treeMap)
```

### Raster

Now let's see how we should get the measurements of bioclimatic variables.
Since most of the bioclimatic variables we will use are raster data, we
will rely on a popular package `raster` for data operations and analysis.

<div class="boxedtext">

Rasters are fantastic tools to store massive amounts of massively cool
data. Think of a raster as a matrix or a grid of numbers, i.e., pixels.
Each pixel in the raster has number associated with it that tells us
something about the data of interest, i.e. How many people live in this
pixel (yes, people have done this using night light data)? How deep is the
groundwater under this pixel (see GRACE satellite)? What kinds of crops
growing in this pixel? You get the idea. 

Most of satellite imagery and data of many climatic related variables are in raster format. The data stored in rasters can be continuous (precipitation, elevation, reflectance) or categorical (land use category). 

- Band
- Resolution (in both space and time)
- Extent
- Values (elevation, land use category, etc.)
- Projection information

The `raster` package includes several raster classes:

 - A `RasterLayer` contains a single-layer raster. This object contains the number of columns and rows in the raster, the spatial extent, pixel values, and the projection information (stored in CRS format)

 - `RasterBricks`, and `RasterStacks` are great for multiband data (i.e. multiple spectral bands, observations through time). The main difference is that a `RasterBrick` can be linked to only one (though multi-layer) file. `RasterStacks` can be made with multiple files (band from one file merged with a band from another file) - though these objects have to have the same extent and resolution.

![Single band (Rasterlayer) vs multi-band (RasterBricks or RasterStacks)](./images/single_multi_raster.png)


The `raster` package can recognize commonly used file extensions: `.grd`,
`.asc`, `.sdat`, `.rst`, `.nc`, `.tif`, `.envi`, `.bil`, `.img` and `.hdf`. 
It also provides a useful command `getData()` to obtain the commonly used
raster datasets, including `SRTM` elevation, `WorldClim` and `CMIP5`
climate projections, from on-line and load directly to `R`.

</div>


The raster data that we will use are bioclimatical variables from
[WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/), which contains mean monthly
climate and derived variables interpolated from weather stations on a 30
arc-second (~1km) grid. The bioclimatical variables we are using contains
19 layers (*bands*):

|Variables| Description |
|-------|--------------------------------|
|BIO1 	|Annual Mean Temperature|
|BIO2 	|Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp – min temp))|
|BIO3 	|Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (* 100)|
|BIO4 	|Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100)|
|BIO5 	|Max Temperature of Warmest Month|
|BIO6 	|Min Temperature of Coldest Month|
|BIO7 	|Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6)|
|BIO8 	|Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter|
|BIO9 	|Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter|
|BIO10 	|Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter|
|BIO11 	|Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter|
|BIO12 	|Annual Precipitation|
|BIO13 	|Precipitation of Wettest Month|
|BIO14 	|Precipitation of Driest Month|
|BIO15 	|Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation)|
|BIO16 	|Precipitation of Wettest Quarter|
|BIO17 	|Precipitation of Driest Quarter|
|BIO18 	|Precipitation of Warmest Quarter|
|BIO19 	|Precipitation of Coldest Quarter|

The bioclimatical data can be obtained by the `raster` function `getData()`

```{r}
# Specify the locations of the data that we are trying to get
centerx= mean(treeLocs$longitude)
centery= mean(treeLocs$latitude)
# Get the bio variable from WorldClim project
bioClim = raster::getData('worldclim',var='bio',res=0.5,lon=centerx,lat=centery)

```

We can explore the data first by checking the numbers of bands, geographic
extent and resolution of the raster and then plotting the data. Note that
the raster we are dealing with are in lat/long coordinates.

```{r}
class(bioClim)
# see the number of bands of the raster
nlayers(bioClim)
# see the resolution of the raster, note it is in lat/long
res(bioClim)
# see the geographic extent of the raster 
extent(bioClim)
# easy way to plot one band of the raster data 
plot(bioClim$bio1_12)
# or simply plot all of them
#plot(bioClim)
#overlay the tree locations on top of the raster and see if the geographic coordinates match:
points(treeLocs$longitude, treeLocs$latitude)
```

We note that the geographic extent of the bioclimatic data is much larger
than the trees, and probably need a cut to better match the extent. The
function `crop()` provided in `raster` can be used for the cut.

```{r}

## define the c
xrange=range(treeLocs$longitude) + c(-0.1, 0.1)
yrange=range(treeLocs$latitude)+ c(-0.1, 0.1)
cropExtent=c(xrange, yrange)
# crop a raster
bioClimClip = crop(bioClim, y=cropExtent)
```

Now the data are almost ready. Let's visualize the raster data and the tree
location using `ggmap` to make the map look more professional.

```{r}

bioClimClip.df=as.data.frame(bioClimClip, xy=TRUE)

# Plot the band `bio1_12` (Annual mean temperature) of the bioclimatic variables
# Note that alpha=0.5 is used to make the raster display in half transparance
bioClimMap = baseMap+ geom_raster(data = bioClimClip.df, aes(x=x, y=y, fill=bio1_12), alpha=0.5) + scale_fill_viridis_c() + coord_quickmap()

# Overlay the trees
bioClimTreeMap = bioClimMap + geom_point(data = treeLocs, mapping = aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red")

# Now add north arrow and scale bar for final touch 
bioClimTreeMap = bioClimTreeMap +
    north(treeLocs)+ 
    scalebar(treeLocs, dist=40, dist_unit="km", transform=TRUE, model="WGS84")

plot(bioClimTreeMap)
```

<div class="question">

**Q1:** Please change the above codes to map the bioclimatic variable
`bio12_12` (annual precipitation) and overlay the tree locations. (15 pts)

**Your answer:**

```{r}
# Please add your code here:
# Load the csv file with lat/long and types
treeLocs <- read.csv(file="Data/trees.csv", header=T)

# Get the background map with google maps
bbox <- make_bbox(lon = treeLocs$longitude, lat = treeLocs$latitude, f = .1)
baseMap <- ggmap(get_map(location = bbox, maptype = "toner", source = "stamen"))

# Specify the locations of the data that we are trying to get
centerx <- mean(treeLocs$longitude)
centery <- mean(treeLocs$latitude)

# Get the bioclimatic variable from WorldClim project
bioClim <- raster::getData('worldclim', var = 'bio', res = 0.5, lon = centerx, lat = centery)

# Define the crop extent
xrange <- range(treeLocs$longitude) + c(-0.1, 0.1)

cropExtent <- c(xrange, yrange)

# Crop the bioclimatic variable raster
bioClimClip <- crop(bioClim, y = cropExtent)

# Convert the cropped bioclimatic variable raster to a data frame for plotting
bioClimClip.df <- as.data.frame(bioClimClip, xy = TRUE)

# Map the bioclimatic variable bio12_12 (annual precipitation) with `geom_raster()`
# Note that alpha=0.5 is used to make the raster display in half transparance
bioClimMap <- baseMap +

  scale_fill_viridis_c() + 
  coord_quickmap()

# Overlay the trees with `geom_point()`
bioClimTreeMap <- bioClimMap + 
  geom_point(data = treeLocs, mapping = aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red")

# Add north arrow and scale bar to make the map more professional
bioClimTreeMap <- bioClimTreeMap + 
  north(treeLocs) + 
  scalebar(treeLocs, dist = 40, dist_unit = "km", transform = TRUE, model = "WGS84")

plot(bioClimTreeMap)

### Prepare the data for package `spatstat`

The package `spatstat` stores data a bit differently than the `sp` or `sf`
package, and it has the following objects (class):

 - `ppp`: planar point pattern
 - `owin`: spatial region or observation window
 - `im`: pixel image
 - `psp`: a pattern of line segments (we won’t cover this in our class, but if you are working with polylines and are interested, check out this text)
 - `tess`: tesselations, tiling using shapes, think shapefile (again we
   don't cover this in the class)

**NOTE:** Point pattern analysis depends on distances and areas so it is
important to have your data in a *projected coordinate system*. So we need
to re-project our data, and format the data we have (trees location and
bioclimatic rasters) in `ppp` and `im`. It sounds tedious, but not really
in practice, the following codes are for this purposes. I put the codes
here for your information. If you feel the codes are long, simply run the codes without worrying about the details. 

```{r}

# Convert the data frame into a SpatialPointDataFrame
coordinates(treeLocs)=c('longitude', 'latitude')

# EPSG:4326 is the code for WGS84 projection
proj4string(treeLocs) = CRS('+init=epsg:4326')
# Reproject the tree locs to EPSG:32611, which represents UTM projection
projLocs<-spTransform(treeLocs, CRS("+init=epsg:32611"))

# Reproject the raster to the same UTM projection
projBioClimClip=projectRaster(bioClimClip, crs=CRS("+init=epsg:32611"))

# Make a ppp object that spatstat uses
xy=coordinates(projLocs)
treePPP<-ppp(xy[,1], xy[,2],range(xy[,1]), range(xy[,2]))
# Rescale from meters to per kilometers
treePPP.km<-rescale(ppp(xy[,1], xy[,2],range(xy[,1]), range(xy[,2])), 1000, "km")

# The following codes convert raster to im object that spatstat use
bio1 = rescale(as.im.RasterLayer(subset(projBioClimClip, 1)), 1000, "km")
names=c("bio1")
bioClim.km =list(bio1)
for (i in 2:nlayers(projBioClimClip)){
    name = paste("bio", i, sep="")
    names=c(names, name)
    bioClim.km[[i]] = rescale(as.im.RasterLayer(subset(projBioClimClip, i)), 1000, "km")
}
names(bioClim.km)=names
```

## Point pattern analysis

The data are now ready for `spatstat` for point pattern analysis. In the
following we will primarily use two data objects, `treePPP.km` for point
patterns and `bioClim.km` for bioclimatic variables. 

### Kernel density estimation

Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a common method to explore the spatial
distribution of point patterns. The function `density()` in `spatstat` is for this purpose. For the tree location data set (`treePPP.km`), we can have the
kernel estimation of intensity by:

```{r}
den30 = density(treePPP.km, sigma=30)
plot(den30)
```

<div class="question">

**Q2:** As we mentioned in the class, the value of *bandwidth* in kernel
density estimation (KDE) can affect the estimated map. Please generate the kernel estimation maps using the bandwidth values (the `sigma` argument) of 20km and
10km respectively. In addition, many methods have been proposed to estimate
the "optimal" bandwidth value, e.g., the function `bw.ppl()`. Please use
`bw.ppl()` to estimate a bandwidth and generate the third map. (10 pts)

**Your answer:**

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
# please type your code here
# Kernel density estimation with sigma=20km
den20 <- density(treePPP.km, sigma=20)
plot(den20, main="Kernel Density Estimation (Bandwidth=20km)")

# Kernel density estimation with sigma=10km
den10 <- density(treePPP.km, sigma=10)
plot(den10, main="Kernel Density Estimation (Bandwidth=10km)")

# Kernel density estimation with optimal bandwidth estimated by bw.ppl()
bw <- bw.ppl(treePPP.km)
denOptimal <- density(treePPP.km, sigma=bw)
plot(denOptimal, main="Kernel Density Estimation (Optimal Bandwidth)")

```
**Q3:** Please look at the estimated maps with bandwidth as 10km. What are
the maximum values and the minimum values of the maps and what does these
numbers mean. (10 pts)

**Your answer: The maximum value in the kernel density estimation map with bandwidth 10 km is 9.255 and the minimum value is 0.0002.These numbers represent the estimated intensity values of the point pattern. The intensity represents the number of trees per unit area. Therefore, the maximum value (9.255) indicates that the highest density of Joshua trees is around 9 trees per square kilometer in the study area, while the minimum value (0.0002) indicates the areas where no trees are observed.**

```{r}
# please type your code here
den10 <- density(treePPP.km, sigma = 10)
max(den10$z)
min(den10$z)
```

It means the intensity, the number of trees per square km


**Q4:** From the maps you generated above, what trend can you find as
different sizes of bandwidth are used? (10 pts)

**Your answer:As the bandwidth size decreases, the estimated density becomes more localized and detailed, showing more variation in tree density across the study area. Conversely, as the bandwidth size increases, the estimated density becomes smoother and more generalized, showing less variation in tree density across the study area. Therefore, choosing an appropriate bandwidth is important in order to accurately represent the spatial pattern of the data.**


</div>

### Hypothesis testing

In point pattern analysis, *complete spatial randomness* (or *in-homogeneous
Poisson point process*) if often used as the null model (null hypothesis)
in hypothesis testing. Then the statistics like *quadrant counting* and *K*
function can be used as the test statistics to compare the observed point
pattern and complete spatial randomness (CSR). Let's first look at what it will look like if the points in `treePPP.km` are completely randomly distributed. 

```{r}
intensity(treePPP.km)
# Random simulate a point pattern with complete spatial randomness with the same intenstity and spatial extent of treePPP.km
randomPPP<-rpoispp(lambda=intensity(treePPP.km), win=Window(treePPP.km))
plot(randomPPP)
```

Complete spatial randomness essentially assume two things: 1) the number of
points is proportional to the area of a sub region and 2) the locations of
points are independent from each other. Quadrat counting test is to test the
first and the Monte Carlo test (based on K,G and F function) is for the later.

#### Quadrat count test

The most basic hypothesis test for point patterns is called the Quadrat Test.
The function `quadrat.test()` can be used to test if a given point pattern
is a CSR. For our `treePPP.km`, we can do:

```{r}
quadrat.test(randomPPP, nx=10, ny=10)
```

<div class="question">

**Q5:** Given the above result of `quadrat.test()`, what conclusion we can
draw about the distribution of `randomPPP` (10 pts)

**Your answer:The result of the quadrat.test() shows that the chi-squared test statistic is 85.239 with 99 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.3274. Since the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness. Therefore, we can conclude that the distribution of randomPPP is consistent with a CSR process.**


**Q6:** Please run the quadrat test on our `treePPP.km` and interpret your
results. (10 pts)

**Your answer:The chi-squared test statistic is 430.34 with 99 degrees of freedom and a very small p-value of less than 2.2e-16. Since the p-value is much less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of CSR and conclude that the tree locations are not randomly distributed.**


```{r}
# Please add your code here:
quadrat.test(treePPP.km, nx=10, ny=10)
```

</div>

#### Monte Carlo test based on Riply's K function

As mentioned previously, quadrat count test is to test if the number of
points is proportional to the area of a sub region. CSR also suggests that the locations of points are independent from each other. Two important violations of independence are:

   - Clustering: Points are clumped. Points are closer together than expected under CSR. In the generating process points “attract” each other. 

   - Dispersion or inhibition: Points are farther apart than expected. This
     can happen when, in the generating process, points repel each other.
 
The K, G, and F functions are distance-based statistics, and can be used to
test if the distribution of points are random, clustering or dispersion. We
will use K function for this lab.


The function `Kest()` can be used to generate the sample K function of a
given point pattern. For example, for CSR case we can randomly simulate a
point pattern and generate the K function as follows:

```{r}
randomPPP2<-rpoispp(lambda=intensity(treePPP.km), win=Window(treePPP.km))
plot(Kest(randomPPP2))
```

As mentioned in the lecture, the distribution of point pattern (random or
clustering or dispersed) can be interpreted by comparing the K curves of
observed point pattern and CSR (above, below or very close). In the above K plot, we can see that K function for `randomPPP2` is very close to the theoretical K function of CSR ($K_{pois}(r)$ in the K plot), which makes sense considering `randomPPP2` is a random sample of CSR. The function `envelope()` can produce a simulation envelope, or a `confidence interval`  of CSR, which can be used for hypothesis testing.

From the below, we can see that the K function for `randomPPP2` falls
within the envelop and it indicates that we cannot reject the hypothesis
that the point pattern in `randomPPP2` are randomly distributed.

```{r}
plot(envelope(randomPPP2, Kest), nsim=39, rank=1)
```

<div class="question">

**Q7:** Please apply and plot the above `envelop()` to the `treePPP.km` and
interpret what you found about the distribution of the trees (random,
clustering and dispersed) (15 pts)

**Your answer:From the plot, we can see that the K function for the tree locations (shown in red) is above the upper simulation envelope, indicating that the trees are clustered more than expected under CSR. Therefore, we can conclude that the distribution of trees is clustered rather than randomly or dispersedly distributed.**


```{r}
# please type your codes here
# Calculate K function for treePPP.km
treeK <- Kest(treePPP.km)

# Generate simulation envelope
env <- envelope(treePPP.km, Kest, nsim = 99)

# Plot the results
plot(env, main = "Simulation envelope for tree locations")
plot(treeK, add = TRUE, col = "red")

```
</div>


### Poisson point process modeling

If events are not equally likely at all points within the window the
process under investigation is said to be *In-homogeneous*. In a
homogeneous process intensity is constant at all location within the
window, in an inhomogenous process intensity varies spatially. We can use
the environmental/auxiliary conditions to estimate the spatially varied
intensity.

Like in linear regression, we can explore the association of the intensity
and a given auxiliary variable. The function `rhohat()` can be used to show
the association of bioclimatic variable `bio1` (annual mean temperature in
unit of Celsius x 10) and the tree intensity.

```{r}
plot(rhohat(treePPP.km, bioClim.km$bio1))
```

We can build a model (Poisson point process model) to estimate the point
pattern intensity with a combination of auxiliary variables. In the
following, all of the 19 bioclimatic variables are used in `ppm()` to model
the intensity of trees. 

```{r}
ppmFull=ppm(treePPP.km~bio1+bio2+bio3+bio4+bio5+bio6+bio7+bio8+bio9+bio10+bio11+bio12+bio13+bio14+bio15+bio16+bio17+bio18+bio19, data= bioClim.km)

plot(envelope(ppmFull, Kest, nsim=99))
```

<div class="question">

**Q8:** From the above plot of K function and envelope, what can you find
about the model `ppmFull`? (10 pts)

**Your answer:The envelope plot shows that the K function for the observed point pattern (trees) falls within the envelope, indicating that the model ppmFull provides a reasonable fit to the data and that the tree locations are not significantly clustered or dispersed after accounting for the environmental/auxiliary conditions. However, it is important to note that the fit of the model may be improved by using additional environmental/auxiliary variables or exploring different modeling approaches.**


**Q9:** A total of 19 variables are used here. In multiple linear
regression, we can use step-wise variable selection (`step()`) to narrow
down the list of the included variables. Please apply the `step()` to the
`ppmFull` for variable selection, and based on the output model please
generate the plot of K function and envelope and interpret the results. (10
pts)

**Your answer:The envelope plot shows that the K function for the observed point pattern falls within the envelope, indicating that the model ppmStep provides a reasonable fit to the data and that the tree locations are not significantly clustered or dispersed after accounting for the selected environmental/auxiliary conditions. The variable selection process may have improved the fit of the model by removing non-significant variables and reducing the risk of overfitting. However, it is important to note that the choice of variables to include in the model may depend on the specific research question and hypotheses, and that different variable selection methods may lead to different results.**


```{r}
# please type your codes here:
# Perform stepwise variable selection
ppmStep <- step(ppmFull, direction = "both")

# Generate plot of K function and envelope for the stepwise model
plot(envelope(ppmStep, Kest, nsim = 99))

```
</div>
